# Project StructFunc

Code for [Prediction of Early Adolescent Functional Connectivity Development
based on Preadolescent Structural Connectivity](https://osf.io/8vx54).

* Flux 2021: **No Correlation Between Preadolescent Structural Connectivity
and Change in Functional Connectivity**

## Goals

1. Find associations between individual variations in structural connectivity
   and change in functional connectivity.
2. Predict future functional connectivity based on structural connectivity and
   additional gene/environment features.

## Directory Structure

* ABCD dataset should be placed in `inputs/ABCD/`.
* All code is located in `code/`.
* Scripts will save outputs to `outputs/`.

## Dependencies

See [conda environment](environment.yml). Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files)
will require Jupyter server and IPython kernel.
